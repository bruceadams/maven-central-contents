# maven-central-contents

A Clojure library designed to gather a table of contents of Maven Central.

## Usage

"lein run" ... well, not quite yet.

This is a helper project for java-gem. I want a full listing of
everything in Maven Central, so I can tease out the full range of
names, especially version naming (hard to call it numbering when there
is so much text in the version strings).
